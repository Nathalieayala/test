Bubble Charts are the least compatible with the data I have. 
The values are a bit misleading as well since neither the x, y axis match the marker size. It is put in manually, Plotly did not show
how to make the sizes match with the output (x). This plot would be great if the marker size did match the points. However, if not then is 
is similar to a scatter plot. It also did not describe how to place names on the axis, only as a title.
